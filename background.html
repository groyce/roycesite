  <h1 align="left">Background</h1>
  <p align="left">I am the Vice President of  Enterprise Architecture and Security at Mutual of Omaha.&nbsp;In that role I am the chief architect and the chief information security officer for Mutual of Omaha. Over a 27-year period, I have focused on  the deployment of strategic technologies in support of key business  projects.&nbsp; This has included the  introduction of client server and then later web technology in the companies.  I have also led the effort to bring in document management and workflow  technologies. Business projects supported by Strategic Technology Development  also included PeopleSoft ERP and Group Insurance Administration and Claims  Processing Systems as well web technology to support Mutual&rsquo;s web presence  including the IFS Sales Professional Access Portal and ecommerce  capabilities.&nbsp; Recently, Strategic  Technology Development has deployed rule engine technologies to automate some  decision-making.&nbsp; To accomplish these  large projects, a central project management team was formed in 1998.&nbsp; I was the founding manager of the team  and developed many early processes to support the matrix organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  also teaches graduate courses  in information technology at the University of Nebraska at Omaha and Creighton  University.&nbsp; They include Managing  Distributed Systems, Enterprise Application Integration, Business Process  Management, Enterprise Content and Document Management and Innovation and Managing  Emerging Technologies.</p>
